You&#39;ve decided to be someone else. Aren&#39;t you a kooky character! Or are you?

What are your character traits in this game?

Are you [[loyal, loving and compassionate-&gt;indecisive]]?

You should be confused. 

All this talk of decision making is (text-colour: red)[stressing me out] - and I&#39;m an impartial audience idly watching on the sidelines. 

If you&#39;re really a bad boy you won&#39;t care about your inability to have control - that is the definition of &quot;bad boy&quot; after all.

It&#39;s a popularity contest based completely on social media; so you don&#39;t actually see any of the other players in person. 
You can choose to be a catfish - if you believe that will give you greater opportunity, however most players are themselves because most people are egotistical, naive, gullible gremlins. 

&lt;img class=&quot;story-image-half&quot; src=&quot;./images/naive.gif&quot; alt=&quot;naive&quot; /&gt;

There are the smart few who choose to be someone else. While this is the much more difficult choice, it is also the choice that gives you greater opportunity, and a much higher chance of winning the game.

You can be whoever the hell you want - you just have to play it right.

(text-colour: grey)[identity is a form of being. 

it is something we all crave but struggle to gain.

it is being given two options

and choosing one

even when you don&#39;t like either option

or you like both

identity is something that seems so easy to have

until we start to lose control of it

and every decision 

seems like life or] (text-colour: red)[death.]

So maybe I&#39;ve been rigging this experience. 

Maybe there&#39;s only one path to take. &lt;img class=&quot;story-image-half&quot; src=&quot;./images/hiding.gif&quot; alt=&quot;hiding&quot; /&gt;

But as long as you believe you were making choices.

Deciding.

Being.

Identifying.
